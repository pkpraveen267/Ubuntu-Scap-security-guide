# OpenSCAP and SCAP Security Guides Installation Guide for Ubuntu Server

## Introduction

STIG, or Security Technical Implementation Guide, is a set of hardware and software configuration standards developed by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). Compliance with STIGs is mandatory for all DoD agencies and organizations using DoD information networks. OpenSCAP, in conjunction with SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) tools, automates STIG compliance scans.

## What is SCAP?

SCAP is a standardized protocol for security automation that facilitates the automation of security-related tasks such as vulnerability scanning, configuration assessment, and compliance checks.

## What is OpenSCAP?

OpenSCAP is an open-source tool that leverages SCAP standards to automate the assessment and validation of STIG compliance.

## Key SCAP Components:

- **OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language):** Standardized language for sharing information on vulnerabilities and security configurations.
- **XCCDF (Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format):** Standard format for expressing security checklists and configuration baselines.
- **OCIL (Open Checklist Interactive Language):** Language for expressing interactive questions in security checklists.
- **CPE (Common Platform Enumeration):** Standardized method for naming and identifying hardware, software, and operating systems.
- **CCE (Common Configuration Enumeration):** Standardized method for identifying and classifying security-relevant configuration issues.
- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):** Dictionary of publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures.
- **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):** Framework for assessing the severity of security vulnerabilities.

## Installing OpenSCAP on Ubuntu Server

```bash
$ sudo apt update# Install SCAP Security Guides

In addition to OpenSCAP, we need to install the SCAP Security Guide (SSG) for our Debian-based system.

SSGs are security policies that transform STIGs (and other security guidelines) into a machine-readable format (XCCDF) that can be used by OpenSCAP to scan your system for vulnerabilities and compliance.

We need the guide for Ubuntu 20.04. To get this, we can download the latest SSG packages from the ComplianceAsCode project.

## Download the Latest Scap Security Guide

```bash
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/pkpraveen267/Ubuntu-Scap-security-guide.git
$ sudo apt install libopenscap8
$ wget https://security-metadata.canonical.com/oval/com.ubuntu.$(lsb_release -cs).usn.oval.xml.bz2
